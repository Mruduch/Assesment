#I have done reasearch on GitHub and BDD method

#GITHUB: I have a littile knowledge on github but now I have got an oppurtunity to explore it which is quite interesting and pretty much
easy to understand. GitHub is a Online Repository where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files from
various compilers where I have tried with Eclipse. I have done reasearch on how to link my project from eclipse to github and sucessfully 
able to perform it with the help of google search.
In Eclipse I have created share project and created a path with Git, then I have done a Remote Push from eclipse to github and I am able 
to see my project online On Github.
