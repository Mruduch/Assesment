I have done reasearch on GitHub and BDD method

GITHUB: I have a littile knowledge on github but now I have got an oppurtunity to explore it which is quite interesting and pretty much
easy to understand. GitHub is a Online Repository where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files from
various compilers where I have tried with Eclipse. I have done reasearch on how to link my project from eclipse to github and sucessfully 
able to perform it with the help of google search.
In Eclipse I have created share project and created a path with Git, then I have done a Remote Push from eclipse to github and I am able 
to see my project online On Github.

BDD: Behaviour driven developement is a process that is emerged from TDD i.e Test Driven Developement these are the software developement
methods which can be used in any methodology escpecially like Agile. BDD is which an application is
specified and designed by describing how its behavior should appear to an outside observer in simple terms using GIVEN, AND, WHEN,THEN..
I have done a reasearch of how it works and  makes easy to create and execute test cases using selenium cucumber in BDD format which is 
pretty interesting and also easy to understand in simple steps.
